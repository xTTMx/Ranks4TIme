Please note that this is my first plugin and I will be needing some help whether your a good coder or amazing as when I grow fond of java and bukkit API I will need somebody of my standard or better to teach me more that I can't learn on my own or just as somebody to go through it with me and be the person that not just sits there pointing out errors and making more ideas but coding themselves :)\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease check up every so often for more updates and more features :)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
